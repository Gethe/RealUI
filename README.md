Installation Procedure
----------------------
### Note: WoW Installation location ###

It is best to NOT have World of Warcraft installed in either "Program Files" or a User folder.

For best results, and to save a lot of headache on your end, I advise moving your World of Warcraft folder straight to the root directory (i.e. C:\ or D:\).

When your World of Warcraft folder is located in Program Files or a User directory, WoW will start doing a lot of crazy things to your WTF and Interface folders, such as storing them in multiple locations and setting high level permissions on them. This can result in addon settings not saving and addons going missing.


### Step 1: Backup ###

  1. Find your "World of Warcraft" folder
  2. Create a new folder called "UIBackup"
  3. Move the "Interface" and "WTF" folders (located in your "World of Warcraft" folder) to the "UIBackup" folder


### Step 2: Copying in RealUI ###

  1. Go to the downloaded "RealUI-xx.zip" file, and open the "RealUI 7# r#" folder
  2. Copy the "Interface", and "WTF" folders into your "World of Warcraft" folder


### Step 3: Renaming folders ###

  1. Go to your "World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\" folder
  2. If you have more than 1 account, copy and Paste the "ACCOUNTNAME" folder to make as many copies as you have Accounts
  3. Rename the "ACCOUNTNAME" folder to your WoW Account name.

Note: If you are unsure of your Account Name, go to the "UIBackup\WTF\Account\" folder and see what the folder/s in there are named.


### Step 4: In Game ###

  1. Once you've logged in, the Installation procedure will begin. Read all prompts carefully :)

Note: Layout can be changed at any time by using the Layout Button at the bottom right area of the screen.

Other options can be changed in the RealUI Options window (/realui).
