--Horridon
Fixed some priorities in anticipation of heroic mode. Tank abilities were too high. Some of the dispellable debuffs or heavy damage debuffs were too low. 

--Durumu 
Fixed priorities so that people can correctly receive heals for more damaging abilities

--Primordius
Added volatile pathogen as top priority

--Iron Qon
Fixed priorities.  Arcing Lightning needed to be lower then other debuffs that are more important (like Freeze and Electrified).
Added Electrified (the stun)

--Twin consorts
Corrupted healing stacks

--Lei'Shen
Fixed priorities.  Static shock and overcharge are 2 most important debuffs for the raid. Made sure nothing else would conflict with their priority.

--Trash
Begin to add trash debuffs.

Updated for 5.2.
This version requires GridStatusRaidDebuff MoP 5.2/r11 or higher.

This will generate a popup warning if you are running an older incompatible
version. I appologize for the pop-up again, but it is better than things
being broken and getting a lot of bug reports.

This change was required because libbabble-zone is deprecated in 5.2 and I
had to rewrite GridStatusRaidDebuff MoP to no longer require it for new
dungeons.  Libbabble-zone is still being included in GridStatusRaidDebuff
for old raid packs that I do not have access to update so they remain
functional as long as possible.
