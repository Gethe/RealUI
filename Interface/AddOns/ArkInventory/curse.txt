AI's display windows are built from "virtual bars", you assign categories to bars so that items in that category are displayed on the specific bars you want. There is no limit to the number of bars you can have inside a window but obviously you only have so much screen real estate before it becomes "too many".


AI uses several methods to assign a default category to an item such as what professions you have, tooltip scanning, basic type/subtype and PeriodicTable. You then assign those categories to a virtual bar.


You can also over-ride the default category by creating a rule that matches either a single or multiple items. 


[b]Overview:[/b]
[list][*]unlimited number of bars (there are practical limits though before your screen becomes full)
[*]assign items to a category of your choice (overrides the default assignment)
[*]assign categories to the bar of your choice
[*]configurable bars per row
[*]configurable width
[*]separate keybindings for bag, keyring and bank viewing
[/list]

See ReadMe.txt and VersionHistory.txt for further details

[b]Beta Versions:[/b]

ensure you make a backup copy of your saved variables file before installing a beta version - you normally cannot revert back to the release version without that backup.  your saved variable file is normally located in World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\yourwowaccountname\SavedVariables\ArkInventory.lua

if you have the curse client set to download beta versions then it is your responsibility to ensure you have adequate backups of your saved variables file - do not complain if you lose them or they get screwed up because you installed a beta version, its what beta versions tend to do.

a simple way to back it up is to just do a copy and paste then rename the new file (using the version number of AI is a good idea), eg ArkInventory-3-01-09.lua
