	- PlayerNames: tracked down previous nil error to battle.net offline toasts, looks like they're actually passing a broken class name now instead of an empty string when the friend was on a wow client
	- ChannelColors: use CHAT_MSG_x globalstrings rather than our own utterly pointless localizations where possible
	- PlayerNames: slightly more elegant solution to previous GetColor bugfix
Sal Scotto:
	- added new chat type support: DRYCODE
durcyn:
	- nil className check in PlayerName:GetColor
Benjamin Staneck:
	- 5.1 TOC
durcyn:
	- fix option hiding for AltNames module
	- acetimer is a finicky piece of shit
	- pull in AceTimer and throttle the GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE loop so we don't overflow the stack on login
	- GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE fires before GetGuildRosterInfo returns anything. loop a few times when this happens so the list can actually be populated on login instead of just reload.
	- support user-configured alt note prefix/suffix strings
	- add options for guild note delimiter characters
	- add alt rank selection options to altnames module, instead of whatever this localization crap was
	- add toggleLabel values to remaining 'Disable' modules so we don't end up with heinous crap like "Enable Disable Server Positioning"
	- apparently we still need the ifcheck, should probably just unhook on PLAYER_LOGOUT instead
	- better fix for ChannelNames after PLAYER_LOGOUT.  not great, but better.
	- avoid obscure nil error in ChannelNames on reloadui
