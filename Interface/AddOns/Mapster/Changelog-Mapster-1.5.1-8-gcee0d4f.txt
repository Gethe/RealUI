Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add FogClear mapping for Krasarang_terrain1
	- Bump .toc
	- Remove WorldMapButton_OnUpdate hook, Blizzard fixed the bug this was trying to fix.
	- Move initializing of the Quest Blob dropdown into the maps OnShow
	This can possibly help to avoid load-time tainting.
	- Don't hide map background in micro dungeons
	- Fix world map button hook
	- Add missing fogclear data for the hidden cliffs in the veiled stair zone.
	- Update Scarlet Halls/Monastery and Scholomance map ids and add new MoP BGs
